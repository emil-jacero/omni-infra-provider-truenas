# Marketing Workspace — omni-infra-provider-truenas

Personal-brand marketing plan for Zac Clifton + the `omni-infra-provider-truenas` project. 6-month content roadmap, all drafts, distribution materials, and tracking.

**Location**: `docs/content/` inside the repo. **Not** published as part of the mkdocs documentation site (`mkdocs.yml` has `exclude_docs: content/` so this whole tree is excluded from the build).

**Why colocated with the repo**: version controlled, single source of truth, accessible from any clone, links to source code (e.g., `internal/singleton/singleton.go`) stay valid.

## How to use

1. Read `00-context/product-marketing.md` first if you're picking this up after a break — that's the foundation.
2. Work month-by-month. Don't jump ahead. Each month's content builds on the last.
3. Within a month, ship in the order indicated by the filename prefix (`01-`, `02-`, `03-`).
4. Before publishing **any** piece: replace all `<placeholder>` strings (live URLs, dev.to slugs).
5. After publishing: come back to the file and replace placeholders with live URLs so future cross-promotion finds the right links.

## Cadence summary (from `00-context/six-month-plan.md`)

| | Per month |
|---|---|
| Long-form written | 1–2 |
| Shareable post (devlog / retro / comparison) | 1 |
| YouTube video | 1 |
| LinkedIn post | ~4 (weekly) |
| Reddit / forum drops | staggered, 1/week max |

## Publishing rules

- **Personal brand first**: bylined "Zac Clifton" on every piece. Bear Binary is the repo, Zac is the face.
- **No simultaneous cross-posting**: stagger Reddit by 3+ days per sub. r/truenas first to tune hooks.
- **No unsolicited upstream PRs**: any catalog/Awesome-list submission goes through `public-pr-guard` flow.
- **No releases as part of marketing**: content cycle never blocks on or triggers a release.

## Tracking

See `_shared/analytics-setup.md` for the tooling. See `_shared/utm-conventions.md` for the URL convention. At the end of M3 and M6, review what compounded.

## Before publishing anything

Run `_shared/publishing-readiness-checklist.md` first. It tracks every global prerequisite + per-piece placeholder + per-publish pre-flight + post-publish action. Don't ship a piece with any unchecked item in its column.

## mkdocs exclusion

This entire tree (`docs/content/`) is excluded from the public docs site via `exclude_docs: content/` in the repo's `mkdocs.yml`. Verify after any mkdocs.yml change by running `mkdocs serve` locally and confirming none of these files appear in the built navigation or search index.
