## [v0.16.1] — Remove unsafe static addressing + surface host-OOM + memory ballooning

### Breaking
- **Remove `additional_nics[*].addresses` and `additional_nics[*].gateway`** — these fields shipped in v0.16.0 but are fundamentally unsafe on a shared MachineClass. Every worker in a MachineSet renders the same class, so a static IP in `addresses` would be claimed by N workers and collide; a static default-route gateway would duplicate across all workers and steer traffic through whichever interface the kernel picked first. There is no safe way to encode per-worker static addressing in a class-shared config. The sanctioned path for pinning specific IPs is an upstream DHCP reservation keyed off the deterministic MAC the provider logs at VM creation — those reservations survive reprovision because the MAC is derived from the machine request ID.
- `DHCP *bool` on `AdditionalNIC` stays. The tri-state simplifies: nil / unset → DHCP enabled (golden path), explicit `true` → same as default, explicit `false` → link attached but left unconfigured for advanced users (bond slave, VLAN parent, manually-applied per-node patch). The `v0.16.0` address-based default heuristic ("nil + addresses set → dhcp=false") is gone because `addresses` is gone.
- Schema: `additional_nics.items` loses `addresses` and `gateway` properties; the remaining `{network_interface, type, mtu, dhcp}` shape is stable going forward.
- Patch builder (`buildAdditionalNICInterfacesPatch`) no longer emits `addresses` or `routes` keys — the output is now strictly `{deviceSelector.hardwareAddr, dhcp}` per NIC. Any MachineRequest that reconciled under v0.16.0 with static fields set keeps the old patch in Omni state until the VM is replaced; v0.16.1 does not retroactively mutate old patches.
- `MaxAddressesPerNIC` constant removed. `MaxAdditionalNICs = 16` stays.
- Validation drops all address/gateway branches (CIDR parse, multicast/loopback/zero-mask reject, gateway family match, on-link check, single-gateway-per-MachineClass check) and the `config_invalid` alert category loses those specific error-message fragments. The category itself stays and still fires on disk-size and duplicate-NIC typos.

### Migration
**Skip v0.16.0.** Upgrade from v0.15.5 straight to v0.16.1. If you already deployed v0.16.0:
1. Edit any MachineClass that sets `additional_nics[*].addresses` or `.gateway` — remove those fields. v0.16.1 rejects them at JSON-schema validation; MachineRequests against such classes will never reconcile until the class is edited.
2. If you need a specific worker pinned to a specific IP on a secondary segment, add a DHCP reservation on the upstream router for the NIC's MAC (visible in provider logs: `attached additional NIC … mac=02:…`).
3. VMs provisioned under v0.16.0 with static patches keep running; replace them against the v0.16.1 class when convenient.

### Tests
- `multinic_test.go`: removed 13 address/gateway tests (static valid, CIDR junk, unspecified, multicast, loopback, gateway invalid-IP, non-unicast, family mismatch, not-on-link, without-addresses, multiple-gateways, NICs-exceed-max-with-addresses, addresses-per-NIC-exceed-max). 3 new tests cover the simplified surface: `DHCPTrue_Allowed`, `DHCPFalse_Allowed`, `AdditionalNICs_ExceedMax`.
- `config_patch_test.go`: removed `StaticAddress`, `StaticWithGateway`, `DHCPPlusStatic` patch-shape tests and the `nil-defaults-to-false-when-addresses-set` resolver case. Kept and pinned: `SingleDHCPNIC` now asserts patch MUST NOT carry `addresses` / `routes` keys.
- `schema_drift_test.go`: field-type map loses `addresses` and `gateway` entries.
- `error_categorization_test.go`: config_invalid test vectors swap address/gateway error strings for duplicate-NIC + NIC-exceeds-max strings.

### Fixes — host-OOM surfacing and memory ballooning
- **Surface "TrueNAS host out of memory" instead of an endless `uploadISO 2/4` UI freeze.** Before this change, when `vm.start` returned the libvirt-relayed `truenas api error (code 12): [ENOMEM] Cannot guarantee memory for guest …`, the provisioner returned the raw error and Omni's step-progress UI stayed pinned on the previously-completed step (uploadISO) while the controller retried every ~60 s indefinitely. Operators saw "stuck on step 2 for an hour" with no visible cause unless they pulled provider logs. The error path now: (1) categorizes ENOMEM into a new `host_oom` provision-error bucket distinct from the existing `memory` bucket (oversized MachineClass) so dashboards and alerts can route them to different operator responses; (2) translates the wire error into a leading "TrueNAS host out of memory: cannot start VM N (name) requesting M MiB" message that names the diagnosis up front; (3) tracks consecutive ENOMEM retries per VM and returns a **permanent** error after `MaxStartOOMAttempts` (default 5) so `MachineRequestStatus.Conditions` shows the failure instead of the controller silently spinning. New `client.IsNoMemory(err)` helper, `client.ErrCodeNoMemory = 12` constant, and `UserFriendlyError` switch case route the wire error consistently across the provisioner. Three call sites updated: stepCreateVM's vm.start, handleExistingVM's vm.start retry, and the post-NVRAM-reset start.
- **Pre-flight memory check now subtracts the running-guest commitment before deciding whether a new VM fits.** Previously the check only compared `memory` against 80% of *total* `physmem`, which let a request through whenever it was small relative to the box even if every byte of free RAM was already locked by other VMs — exactly the v0.16.0 incident pattern (`talos-home-workers-f9xkk2` failed step 3 because two earlier VMs had committed 28 GiB of a 32 GiB host before this one ran). The new check sums `memory` of every RUNNING guest via a single `vm.query` and rejects requests where the *actual reservation* (`min_memory` if set, otherwise `memory`) exceeds 90% of remaining free MiB, with a hint pointing at `min_memory` when not configured. The single-VM 80%-of-total ceiling stays as a second guard against ZFS ARC starvation. The aggregate query is best-effort: a `vm.query` failure logs at debug and falls back to the original ceiling rather than blocking provisioning on an observability call.
- **Add `min_memory` to MachineClass — soft floor for memory ballooning.** New optional `min_memory` field (MiB, ≥ 1024 when set, ≤ `memory`) maps to TrueNAS's existing `vm.create` `min_memory` parameter. When set, the VM launches with `min_memory` reserved and balloons up to `memory` as host RAM is available — letting operators over-commit on tight hosts without hitting ENOMEM at start. When unset (the default), behavior is unchanged: `memory` is fully reserved. The `memory` field's schema description was rewritten to call out that it's the **maximum / hard limit** and that `min_memory` is the soft-floor escape hatch. The pre-flight check above compares against `min_memory` when set, so a balloon config that legitimately oversubscribes the ceiling no longer fails validation. Caveat documented in the schema description, the new docs section, and the sizing guide: the Talos kernel does not auto-load `virtio-balloon`, so until balloon is explicitly enabled in-guest the VM will sit at `min_memory` and `memory` becomes a ceiling that's never reached — in practice, size `min_memory` to what Talos actually needs.

### Tests — host-OOM and balloon coverage
- `internal/client/vm_test.go`: `TestRunningGuestsMemoryMiB_OnlyCountsRunning` (RUNNING-only summation; STOPPED guests excluded), `TestRunningGuestsMemoryMiB_EmptyHost`, and `TestIsNoMemory` (code 12, message-fallback `[ENOMEM]` and `Cannot guarantee memory`, code 28 ENOSPC negative case, non-API error, nil).
- `internal/provisioner/error_categorization_test.go`: 5 new `host_oom` test vectors covering the raw libvirt string, the translated leading message, the permanent-failure suffix, the pre-flight rejection wording, and the `UserFriendlyError` output.
- `internal/provisioner/steps_test.go`: `TestHandleExistingVM_Stopped_StartFails_ENOMEM` (operator-actionable wording on the existing-VM start path), `TestTranslateStartError_PermanentAfterMaxAttempts` (fail-fast pinned at the configured budget), `TestTranslateStartError_NonOOMPassesThrough` (counter doesn't advance on non-OOM errors), `TestClearOOMAttempts_ResetsCounter`. The legacy `TestHandleExistingVM_Stopped_StartFails` was updated to assert the new `failed to start VM <id> (<name>)` wording instead of the deprecated `failed to start existing VM` substring.
- `internal/provisioner/data_test.go`: 7 new validation cases for `min_memory` (zero accepted, negative rejected, below `MinMemoryMiB` rejected, above `memory` rejected with field-named error, equal-to-memory accepted, between-floor-and-memory accepted, and the no-balloon path).

### Docs — host-OOM and balloon coverage
- `docs/troubleshooting.md`: new "VM creation succeeds but VM won't start: host out of memory" section with the symptom (frozen `uploadISO 2/4` UI), the root cause (KVM-level guard, not bypassable), `midclt` diagnostic commands, and four prioritized fixes (stop another VM, set `min_memory`, manual `vm.update` override on the stuck VM, reduce `memory`, add RAM).
- `docs/sizing.md`: new bullet under "Rules of thumb worth knowing" calling out `memory` as a hard reservation by default and `min_memory` as the balloon escape hatch with the Talos virtio-balloon caveat.
- `docs/quickstart.md`: `memory` row description rewritten to flag it as the hard / max limit; new `min_memory` row with the soft-floor explanation and a link to the troubleshooting section.

## [v0.16.0] — 2026-04-23 — Multi-NIC auto-config + experimental autoscaler + raised root disk floor

### Breaking
- **Raise `disk_size` minimum from 5 GiB to 20 GiB on the root disk** — the additional-disk floor stays at 5 GiB, but the primary / OS disk now fails validation below 20. Rationale lives in [`docs/sizing.md#why-the-root-disk-has-a-20-gib-minimum`](https://github.com/bearbinary/omni-infra-provider-truenas/blob/main/docs/sizing.md#why-the-root-disk-has-a-20-gib-minimum): a Talos CP node pulls kube-apiserver + kube-controller-manager + kube-scheduler + etcd + kube-proxy + CNI + CoreDNS during bootstrap, plus the Talos squashfs image and kubelet's 10% GC headroom. A 5–10 GiB root disk fills up mid-install, the kubelet evicts images mid-pull, and etcd never comes up — observed on the `5 GiB` default path before this change. New `MinRootDiskSizeGiB` const in `internal/provisioner/data.go`, validator message cites the bootstrap reason, `schema.json` updated to `"minimum": 20` with matching description. Migration: any MachineClass currently specifying `disk_size` < 20 will fail validation on next apply — edit the value to ≥ 20 (default `40` recommended for production) before provisioning. Existing VMs built against an older class are not retroactively resized; reprovision against the updated class if you hit DiskPressure.

### Fixes
- **Auto-configure every additional NIC (DHCP, static addresses, gateway)** — `stepCreateVM` now emits a `nic-interfaces` ConfigPatchRequest alongside the existing `nic-mtu` patch whenever `additional_nics` are declared on the MachineClass. The patch writes `machine.network.interfaces[]` entries keyed by `deviceSelector.hardwareAddr` with `dhcp`, `addresses`, and per-interface default-route `routes` derived from the new `AdditionalNIC` fields. Talos's default platform config (nocloud, metal, …) only DHCPs the primary link, so before this fix additional NICs came up at the link layer but never acquired an IPv4 address — VMs were effectively single-homed despite the hypervisor attaching the extra vNIC correctly. Observed on `talos-home` workers running v0.15.5: `talosctl get links` showed both `eth0` and `eth1` UP with `linkState: true`, but `talosctl get addresses` showed `eth1` with only `fe80::/64` and no IPv4. MAC-based matching (not interface-name matching) is used because Talos's interface enumeration can shift between boots while the deterministic MACs the provider assigns survive reprovision. Orthogonal to `advertised_subnets` — that pins kubelet/etcd to a specific subnet but does not bring additional links up. Worker-safe: no `cluster.*` section, so no risk of the v0.15.0–v0.15.3 etcd-on-worker validation bug returning.

  New `AdditionalNIC` fields (all optional, backward-compatible):
  - `dhcp` (`*bool`) — tri-state. Unset → default `true` when no static addresses, `false` when `addresses` is set. Explicit `true` or `false` always wins, so "DHCP + static alias on the same link" and "attach the NIC but disable all autoconfig" are both expressible.
  - `addresses` (`[]string`) — static IPv4/IPv6 addresses in CIDR form. Validated with `net.ParseCIDR` at config-load time; bad entries are rejected with a field-indexed error before the VM is touched.
  - `gateway` (`string`) — optional default-route IP. Only meaningful alongside `addresses` — a gateway without addresses is rejected as a config mistake (DHCP supplies its own gateway; a static-only route with no link address can't be installed).

  New `buildAdditionalNICInterfacesPatch` builder + `resolveNICDHCP` policy helper. 20 new regression tests: 4 for the DHCP-default resolver (nil→true/false, explicit true/false), 11 for patch shape (DHCP on/off, static address, static+gateway, DHCP+static coexistence, multi-NIC mixed, empty list→nil, empty-MAC skip, all-empty→nil, JSON structure pin, no-cluster-section pin), 7 for `Validate` (valid CIDR, invalid CIDR, junk, valid gateway, invalid gateway IP, gateway-without-addresses rejected, DHCP-false-with-no-addresses allowed). Schema drift test guards the three new fields in `cmd/omni-infra-provider-truenas/data/schema.json` against silent removal.

### Hardening (parallel-review follow-up, same session)
- **Tighter address/gateway validation.** `Data.Validate` now rejects interface addresses that are unspecified (`0.0.0.0/0`, `::/0`), multicast, loopback, or zero-length-mask; rejects gateways that are unspecified, multicast, loopback, or IPv4 broadcast; enforces IPv4/IPv6 family match between gateway and at least one address; enforces that the gateway is on-link with at least one of the configured CIDRs; and rejects MachineClasses declaring a gateway on more than one additional NIC (non-deterministic default-route ambiguity). Closes the "malicious-operator-of-a-MachineClass" footguns where a bad value would either fail at Talos apply-time or silently steer worker traffic.
- **Operator-input DoS caps.** `MaxAdditionalNICs = 16` and `MaxAddressesPerNIC = 16` enforced in `Validate()` and as `maxItems` in `schema.json`. Prevents a misconfigured MachineClass with 10k entries from serializing a multi-MB ConfigPatchRequest that Omni stores + every reconcile re-fetches.
- **Schema-side regex for fast-fail.** `addresses` items gain `pattern: ^[0-9a-fA-F:.]+/[0-9]{1,3}$` and `gateway` gains `^[0-9a-fA-F:.]+$` in `schema.json` — catches "forgot the `/24`" typos at MachineClass apply time (Omni-side JSON-schema gate) rather than deferring the failure to provision time.
- **Route network picked by gateway family.** `buildAdditionalNICInterfacesPatch` emits `network: "::/0"` when the gateway is IPv6, `"0.0.0.0/0"` when IPv4 — previously always IPv4 regardless of family, which Talos rejects at apply for IPv6 gateways.
- **Duplicate-MAC reject in patch builder.** `buildAdditionalNICInterfacesPatch` returns an error on duplicate `deviceSelector.hardwareAddr` — defense-in-depth against upstream MAC-collision-resolution bugs that would otherwise produce last-write-wins ambiguity in Talos.
- **`disk_size` floor coverage.** `data_test.go` pins `MinRootDiskSizeGiB = 20`: 19 rejected, 20 accepted, 5 rejected. Prevents a future refactor from silently restoring the undersized floor that caused control-plane DiskPressure GC loops during bootstrap.

### Observability (parallel-review follow-up, same session)
- **`config_invalid` and `config_patch` error-category buckets.** `categorizeError` now routes MachineClass validation failures (wrapped via `"invalid MachineClass config: %w"`) to `config_invalid` and every `CreateConfigPatch` failure to `config_patch`, so dashboards and alert routing can distinguish operator typos from hypervisor regressions and pinpoint which patch kind is failing. Previously both classes aliased into `nic_invalid` / `unknown`.
- **`truenas.config_patch.duration` histogram.** New `Float64Histogram` in `internal/telemetry/metrics.go` with a `patch_kind` label covers all five patch-emission RPCs (`data-volumes`, `longhorn-ops`, `nic-mtu`, `nic-interfaces`, `advertised-subnets`). Buckets mirror `APICallDuration`. Wraps every call via the new `applyConfigPatch` helper so timing is recorded on success and failure alike.
- **Warn log on empty-MAC NIC skip.** When `AddNICWithConfig` succeeds but TrueNAS returns no MAC attribute, the NIC is silently skipped from the patch — with this fix, a Warn log now fires (not just Debug) so SRE can correlate when a multi-homed VM comes up with fewer IPs than the operator declared.
- **Aggregate breakdown in `applied additional-NIC interfaces config patch` Info log.** Carries `dhcp_nics`, `static_nics`, `gateway_nics` counts. SRE can verify "is the static-address codepath actually firing?" during a rollout without enabling Debug everywhere.

### Refactor (parallel-review follow-up, no behavior change)
- **`collectNICInterfaceConfigs` pure helper.** Extracts the per-NIC config+aggregate accumulation out of `stepCreateVM`'s attach loop so it's unit-testable without a live `provision.Context`, TrueNAS client, or VM. Panics on `len(nics) != len(attachedMACs)` (caller bug, not recoverable). `resolveNICDHCP` now called once per NIC (was twice — hoist).
- **`applyConfigPatch(ctx, pctx, kind, requestID, data)` helper.** Centralizes `patchName()` + `CreateConfigPatch` + timing metric for all five patch kinds. AST-level static check updated: `collectPatchNameKinds` now recognizes both `patchName(<kind>, ...)` and `applyConfigPatch(ctx, pctx, <kind>, ...)` so the wiring registry stays accurate across the refactor.
- **`boolPtr` test helper centralized.** Moved from `config_patch_test.go` into `testhelpers_test.go` so new `*_test.go` files in the package don't duplicate it.

### Tests (parallel-review follow-up)
- **23 new tests** across `config_patch_test.go`, `multinic_test.go`, `data_test.go`, `schema_drift_test.go`, `error_categorization_test.go`: caller-seam wiring for `collectNICInterfaceConfigs` (5), extended validation (unspecified / multicast / loopback addresses, gateway non-unicast, family mismatch, not-on-link, multiple gateways, max caps), `config_invalid`/`config_patch` error categorization, schema-drift type pins, `MinRootDiskSizeGiB` floor pin.
- **Patch-kind registry entry for `nic-interfaces`.** `TestStepCreateVM_WiresAllExpectedPatches` now asserts the kind appears in a non-test source file, so a refactor that deletes the emission site (silently reverting the v0.15.5 fix) fails CI.

### Documentation (parallel-review follow-up)
- **Talos round-trip gap documented.** `docs/testing.md` now carries a "Known test-coverage gaps" section explaining that Go-side unit tests pin the provider's understanding of Talos config shape but don't round-trip through `config.NewFromBytes` — so the v0.15.0 etcd-on-worker regression class can recur silently. Lists the two ways to close the gap (test-only dep on `machinery/config`, or `-tags e2e` cassette against `talosctl apply`).

### Experimental
- **Autoscaler Helm chart + operator docs (phase 4 of 4)** — `deploy/helm/omni-autoscaler/` ships a two-container chart (autoscaler subcommand + upstream `cluster-autoscaler` sidecar) with full values surface for Omni + TrueNAS credentials, per-cluster opt-in, experimental labels (`bearbinary.com/experimental=true`), and Recreate rollout strategy so no two autoscaler replicas are ever alive simultaneously. Chart renders cleanly against `helm lint` / `helm template`. `docs/autoscaler.md` is the operator guide: full annotation reference, deploy recipe, RBAC notes, observability, how to disable, and the known-limitations list (no scale-down, no scale-from-zero, no host-mem check until the `system.mem_info` wrapper lands). Feature is end-to-end deployable but still experimental — the combination of per-MachineClass opt-in, hard-gate-by-default capacity check, scale-down-disabled-at-two-layers, and single-replica rollout gives operators four independent layers to disable if something goes wrong.
- **Autoscaler write path wired (phase 3d of 4)** — `internal/autoscaler/writer.go` implements `ScaleWriter.IncreaseMachineCount` via `safe.StateUpdateWithConflicts[*omni.MachineSet]` with a live re-check of Max inside the mutator so a stale `CurrentSize` in the caller can't bypass the bound even if Omni's OCC would have let the write land. `Server.NodeGroupIncreaseSize` is the first mutating RPC: validates input (delta > 0, non-empty id) → re-runs Discover for a fresh current-size read → runs the capacity gate when one is wired → invokes the writer → logs the structured scale event. Errors map to the specific gRPC status codes cluster-autoscaler uses for scheduling decisions: `ResourceExhausted` on capacity breach or Max violation (CAS stops retrying), `InvalidArgument` on bad delta (no retry), `NotFound` on unknown group (prune from CAS cache), `Unavailable` on transient state errors (retry later). New `AnnotationAutoscalePool` + `Config.Pool` field let operators target a specific TrueNAS pool for capacity checks; falls back to `Server.WithDefaultPool(…)` (set from `DEFAULT_POOL` in the subcommand wiring). Subcommand now builds the full production dependency tree: Omni client, TrueNAS client (optional — absent means "capacity gate disabled" with a warn log, useful for dry-run deploys), Discoverer, ScaleWriter, and passes all into `NewServer`. `TestServer_NodeGroupIncreaseSize_*` covers happy path + the reject-with-status matrix (invalid delta, above max, unknown group); `TestScaleWriter_*` covers the write semantics including the live-recheck race guard. Correctness does not depend on a singleton lease — Omni's optimistic concurrency rejects stale writes on its own — but the chart still pins `replicas: 1` to avoid wasted API calls.
- **Autoscaler subcommand skeleton (phase 1 of 4)** — `omni-infra-provider-truenas autoscaler` is the new experimental entry point for a Kubernetes cluster-autoscaler external-gRPC cloud provider, vendored from Justin Rothgar's `omni-node-autoscaler` PoC. Opt-in per MachineClass via `bearbinary.com/autoscale-min` / `bearbinary.com/autoscale-max` annotations on Omni `MachineClass.omni.sidero.dev` resources; a class without the annotations is not discovered. Optional `bearbinary.com/autoscale-capacity-gate` (`hard` or `soft`) controls whether TrueNAS pool/host-memory pressure blocks scale-up. Phase 1 scope is intentionally narrow: env-var config (`OMNI_CLUSTER_NAME`, `AUTOSCALER_LISTEN_ADDRESS`, `AUTOSCALER_REFRESH_INTERVAL`), annotation parser with full table-driven coverage, experimental startup banner, and a hold-open loop. No gRPC server and no Omni writes yet — those land in phases 2–3. The provisioner subcommand (no argv) is unchanged; existing Deployments bumping image tags see zero behavior drift.
- **Autoscaler read-side gRPC handlers wired (phase 3c of 4)** — `Server` now takes a `*Discoverer` and uses it to answer `NodeGroups` (returns the discovered `[]NodeGroup` translated into proto form — `id`/`minSize`/`maxSize`/`debug`) and `NodeGroupTargetSize` (returns current `MachineAllocation.MachineCount`). `NodeGroupForNode` returns an explicit nil-NodeGroup "not ours" response through the experimental phase — scale-down is disabled at multiple layers, and the node→node-group mapping requires additional Omni state (MachineSetNode / ClusterMachine joins) that isn't worth the surface area while scale-down stays off. When the Server is booted without a Discoverer (early-phase testing, partial boot), handlers return Unimplemented with an operator-readable "discoverer missing" message rather than silently returning an empty list — silent-empty is indistinguishable from "cluster has no opted-in MachineSets" which is a legitimate steady state. 6 new `TestServer_*` cases cover the happy path (NodeGroups returns minSize/maxSize/debug), empty-cluster non-error, TargetSize found + NotFound, and the two configured/unconfigured NodeGroupForNode paths. Write handlers (`NodeGroupIncreaseSize`) still return Unimplemented; phase 3d enables them behind the singleton lease.
- **Autoscaler MachineSet discovery (phase 3b of 4)** — `internal/autoscaler/discovery.go` resolves one Omni cluster's autoscaler-managed node groups from a COSI state source. `Discoverer.Discover` enumerates `MachineSets` via `state.WithLabelQuery(resource.LabelEqual(omni.LabelCluster, cluster))`, skips control-plane MachineSets (no CP scaling support), rejects `Unlimited` allocations with a structured warning log, dereferences each worker's `MachineClass` by `MachineAllocation.Name`, parses the `bearbinary.com/autoscale-*` annotations via `ParseMachineClassAutoscaleConfig`, and returns a `[]NodeGroup` the gRPC handlers will consume in phase 3c. Per-MachineSet failures (missing MachineClass, bad annotations, unsupported allocation type) log and skip the offending set — one misconfiguration never takes out scaling for the whole cluster. `TestDiscover_*` covers 9 scenarios against an inmem COSI state (the same pattern singleton tests use): empty cluster, other-cluster filtering, CP skip, non-opted-in skip, Unlimited reject, bad-annotation-skips-one, config propagation, missing-MachineClass skip, and out-of-bounds-still-included. The gRPC handlers still return `Unimplemented` — phase 3c wires discovery into `NodeGroups` / `NodeGroupForNode` / `NodeGroupTargetSize`; phase 3d enables the write path.
- **Autoscaler gRPC server scaffold (phase 3a of 4)** — `internal/autoscaler/server.go` wires the external-gRPC cluster-autoscaler cloud-provider contract via vendored protos under `internal/autoscaler/proto/externalgrpc/` (Apache-2.0, from Kubernetes Autoscaler; see `PROVENANCE.md` for refresh workflow). Server boots cleanly, binds the listener, answers RPC calls, and returns `codes.Unimplemented` on every handler with an operator-readable message naming the next phase. Graceful shutdown drains on ctx cancel. `google.golang.org/grpc` promoted from indirect to direct in `go.mod`. `TestServer_*` exercises the full listen → dial → RPC → shutdown lifecycle against ephemeral ports so CI can't collide with the default `:8086` or other tests. Every RPC handler is defined explicitly (rather than relying on the generated `UnimplementedCloudProviderServer` default) so the list of capabilities the autoscaler must support is literal and searchable — phases 3b (MachineSet discovery) and 3d (Omni writes) slot in one handler at a time.
- **Autoscaler capacity gate (phase 2 of 4)** — `internal/autoscaler/capacity.go` implements the TrueNAS-aware scale-up gate. Decision table: `OutcomeAllowed` (both thresholds pass or disabled), `OutcomeDeniedHard` (hard gate + threshold breached), `OutcomeWarnedSoft` (soft gate + threshold breached, still proceeds), `OutcomeErrored` (capacity query failed — fails closed). Pool-free-bytes check reads TrueNAS via the existing `ListPools` path (matches UI-reported values, accounts for ZFS parity/metadata overhead). Host-free-memory check is interface-only for this phase: `TrueNASCapacityAdapter.HostFreeMemoryBytes` returns `ErrHostMemNotImplemented` until a follow-up adds an `internal/client` wrapper for `system.mem_info`; operators who want to deploy now must set `bearbinary.com/autoscale-min-host-mem-gib: "0"` on annotated MachineClasses to disable the host-mem dimension until the wrapper lands. `TestCheckCapacity` covers all 11 decision-table branches; `TestTrueNASCapacityAdapter_*` pins the adapter behavior against a mock client. Still no gRPC server and no Omni writes — phase 3 wires both together behind a singleton lease.

## [v0.15.5] — Regression-test hardening: TrueNAS call-site shape pinning + method allowlist

### Tests (no behavior change)
- **Wire-shape pins for high-risk call sites** — `internal/client/wire_shape_test.go` now asserts the exact JSON params we send to `vm.delete`, `vm.stop` (force + graceful), and `pool.dataset.delete` via `assert.JSONEq`. Adds or drops a key and the test fails. This is the direct guard against a future `force_after_timeout`-style regression — the v0.15.1 bug would have been caught at `go test` time because the strict shape assertion rejects any extra key.
- **Known-methods allowlist** — `internal/client/method_allowlist_test.go` maintains a committed list of every TrueNAS JSON-RPC method the provider calls and cross-references it against the source at test time. Fails when a call site uses a method not on the list (new integration point, or a typo like `vm.deletee`) AND when an entry on the list is no longer referenced anywhere in non-test code (dead allowlist entries can mask typos during review). Resolves method-name constants (`methodVMQuery = "vm.query"`), direct literals, and the `Method: "X"` pattern used for non-JSON-RPC calls like `filesystem.put`.

## [v0.15.4] — Emergency: stop shipping `cluster.etcd.advertisedSubnets` to workers

### Fixes (Critical)
- **Split the `advertised-subnets` ConfigPatch by machine role** — `buildAdvertisedSubnetsPatch` unconditionally emitted `cluster.etcd.advertisedSubnets` alongside `machine.kubelet.nodeIP.validSubnets`. The caller in `stepCreateVM` applied the same patch to every MachineRequest in multi-NIC mode (whether `advertised_subnets` was set explicitly or auto-detected from the primary NIC). Talos rejects `cluster.etcd.*` on workers with `configuration validation failed: etcd config is only allowed on control plane machines` — every worker in a multi-homed cluster failed validation, never booted, never joined. Observed in prod on `talos-home` (multi-homed, 3 workers all DOA post-v0.15.0). Fix: new `buildKubeletSubnetsPatch` emits only the worker-safe `machine.kubelet.*` portion; `stepCreateVM` now detects CP role from the `MachineRequestSet` label suffix (`-control-planes` per Omni's convention) and calls the full builder only when on a CP. Conservative on ambiguity (unknown suffix → worker path) because skipping etcd pinning on a CP is a latent issue, while shipping etcd config to a worker is an immediate brick. `TestBuildKubeletSubnetsPatch_OmitsEtcd` pins the worker patch shape against future refactors that might silently merge the builders again.

### Observability
- **`recordProvisionError` now skips `context.Canceled`** — both standalone and wrapped in `RequeueError`. Shutdown-triggered cancellation is not a provision failure; counting it as one conflates operator restarts with real regressions. Table in `TestRecordProvisionError_RequeueUnwrap` extended with three new cases.

### Tests (regression guards for this week's bugs)
- **`internal/telemetry/histogram_buckets_test.go`** — records a known 50 ms value into every Float64Histogram and fails if any instrument inherits the OTel SDK's millisecond-default bucket boundaries against the seconds unit. Would have caught v0.15.0's histogram-unit regression at `go test ./...`.
- **`internal/client/cassette_age_test.go`** — fails when any cassette in `testdata/cassettes/` is older than `CASSETTE_MAX_AGE_DAYS` (default 90). Forces re-record pressure before stale cassettes silently hide schema drift (the v0.15.0 orphan-cleanup cassette kept passing for a reason).

## [v0.15.3] — Stop orphan cleanup from deleting freshly-created v0.15+ VMs

### Fixes (Critical)
- **`cleanupOrphanVMs` now reads the request-id from the VM description instead of name-deriving it** — The hourly orphan sweep was deleting healthy, newly-provisioned VMs because v0.15.0 changed the VM name format from `omni_<requestID>` to `omni_<providerID>_<requestID>` but the cleanup code still derived the expected request-id as `strings.ReplaceAll(strings.TrimPrefix(name, "omni_"), "_", "-")`. That produced `truenas-talos-preview-control-planes-abc` for a VM whose zvol was tagged `org.omni:request-id=talos-preview-control-planes-abc` — no match → flagged as orphan → stopped + deleted. Live impact: every v0.15+ cluster member was destroyed within an hour of provision finishing, log-visible as `created VM → VM started → removing orphan VM (backing zvol not found)` on the same VM ID. Fixed by parsing the request-id out of the VM description (`"Managed by Omni infra provider (request-id: X)"`) via new `meta.ParseRequestIDFromDescription` — the description is the canonical store and is not affected by the name namespacing change. VMs without a parseable request-id are now skipped (legacy v0.14 look-alikes are safer as manual-cleanup than as accidental-delete). `TestParseRequestIDFromDescription` pins six parsing cases; existing `TestCleanupOrphanVMs_*` tests updated with description-bearing mocks. `TestIntegration_OrphanVMCleanup` skipped under replay until its cassette is re-recorded against a live TrueNAS.

## [v0.15.2] — Emergency: drop invalid `force_after_timeout` from `vm.delete`

### Fixes
- **Remove invalid `force_after_timeout: true` from `DeleteVM` options** — v0.15.1 passed `{force: true, force_after_timeout: true}` to `vm.delete`, but TrueNAS 25.10 rejects the second option: `truenas api error (code 11): [EINVAL] options.force_after_timeout: Extra inputs are not permitted`. That option exists on `vm.stop`, not `vm.delete`. Live impact: on every Deprovision retry the provider first `StopVM`'d the target (graceful ACPI, succeeded), then `DeleteVM` failed at the schema check. VMs ended up **stopped but not deleted**, the SDK held the finalizer, and the loop replayed every 15s — causing `truenas_shutdown_graceful_total` to climb 195× in 3h and leaving previously-running cluster members powered off. `DeleteVM` now passes only `{force: true}`. `TestDeleteVM_Success` pins the exact param shape to block this regression returning.

## [v0.15.1] — Post-release stuck-teardown fixes from Grafana audit + CI protoc pin

### Fixes
- **`recordProvisionError` no longer treats the SDK's `RequeueError` as a failure** — v0.15.0 changed `recordProvisionError` to log every provision step error at Error level and bump `truenas_provision_errors_total`. That applied to `*controller.RequeueError` too, whose `Error()` string is just `"requeue in <duration>"` — a benign retry signal, not a failure. Live evidence from bearbinary.grafana.net after the v0.15.0 rollout showed 9 MachineRequests each producing a storm of Error-level "provision error" log lines with `error_category="unknown"` that were actually normal step waits, drowning out real failures and polluting the errors counter. Fixed in `internal/provisioner/steps.go`: if the error is a `RequeueError`, unwrap via `.Err()`; log + count only when the inner error is non-nil, otherwise return silently. `TestRecordProvisionError_RequeueUnwrap` pins the three cases (pure requeue, requeue wrapping a real error, non-requeue pass-through).
- **`client.IsNotFound` now recognises TrueNAS's `MatchNotFound()` response** — `vm.query`, `pool.dataset.query`, `disk.query` and the other `query` methods return `{code: 22, message: "MatchNotFound()"}` (NOT code 2 / ENOENT) when called with `{"get": true}` and the filter matches zero rows. `IsNotFound` only matched code 2, so the v0.15.0 ownership check in `cleanupVM` propagated `failed to read VM N for ownership check: MatchNotFound()` on every Deprovision call for a VM already deleted externally — the SDK then requeued the teardown forever, holding the finalizer and leaving Machines stuck in `tearing down`. Production impact observed post-v0.15.0 rollout: 7 machines from the talos-preview teardown cycle wedged with destroy-never-completed because their VM IDs had been removed on TrueNAS out-of-band. Fixed in `internal/client/truenas.go`: `IsNotFound` now also accepts code 22 when the message contains `MatchNotFound`. Keeps a genuine EINVAL (code 22 with any other message) as a real error. `TestIsNotFound` extended with both cases.
- **`DeleteVM` passes `{force: true, force_after_timeout: true}`** — `vm.delete` with no options internally stops the VM first and refuses with `EFAULT VM state is currently not 'RUNNING / SUSPENDED'` if the VM is in a transitional state (STOPPING, LOCKED, STARTING, …). That was the exact path orphan cleanup ran into during the stuck-teardown aftermath, producing `failed to delete orphan VM (id=638): truenas api error (code 14)` and making orphan cleanup pointless for the VMs it was most needed for. Forcing the delete skips the precondition, which is the correct behavior for a provider that owns the VMs and is tearing them down.

### CI
- **Correct the pinned SHA256 for `protoc-27.1-linux-x86_64.zip` in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`** — v0.15.0 shipped with `6125d83c…`, which doesn't match the artifact published on the `v27.1` release (the correct SHA is `8970e3d8…`). Every post-v0.15.0 CI `make generate` job failed at the `sha256sum -c -` gate before it ever invoked protoc. Verified by downloading the actual artifact and confirming it's a real 9.4 MB Linux x86_64 `bin/protoc` + the standard `include/` tree.

## [v0.15.0] — Security hardening pass + observability corrections (validation, transport, secrets, ownership, extensions, TOFU ISO, fencing, WS mutex split, CI SHA-pinning, histogram buckets, singleton malformed-200 workaround)

### Observability
- **Histogram buckets now match the recorded unit** — All six `Float64Histogram` instruments in `internal/telemetry/metrics.go` (`truenas.api.duration`, `truenas.provision.duration`, `truenas.deprovision.duration`, `truenas.iso.download.duration`, `truenas.provision.step.duration`, `truenas.deprovision.step.duration`) now pass `metric.WithExplicitBucketBoundaries(...)` explicitly. Previously the OTel SDK defaults (`[0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000]`) were treated as milliseconds against a metric unit of seconds, pushing every call <5s into the first populated bucket and making `histogram_quantile()` return the bucket midpoint (~2.5s p50, ~4.95s p99) regardless of real latency. Real average for `pool.query` is ~19ms; dashboards were reading ~250× too high. New boundaries: API `[1ms…30s]`, provision `[5s…1h]`, deprovision `[1s…10m]`, ISO download `[1s…15m]`, step `[100ms…5m]`, deprovision step `[100ms…2m]`.
- **Provision errors are now logged at Error level with their category** — `recordProvisionError` in `internal/provisioner/steps.go` previously only incremented the `truenas_provision_errors_total` counter and attached the error to the active span. The counter was observable but the error text was not — leaving operators with a number but no way to find the root cause in Loki. Function now also emits `logger.Error("provision error", zap.String("error_category", …), zap.Error(err))`. Signature gained a `*zap.Logger` parameter; all four call sites (createSchematic, uploadISO, createVM, healthCheck) updated.

### Resilience
- **Singleton lease release tolerates upstream siderolabs/omni#2642** — `Lease.Release` previously surfaced the Omni gRPC-gateway's `"unexpected HTTP status code received from server: 200 (OK); malformed header: missing HTTP content-type"` response as a Warn, leaving operators to believe the heartbeat/instance-id annotations were stuck on the resource and that the successor would have to wait `staleAfter` to take over. The response body actually writes successfully on the server — the gRPC client rejects an otherwise-valid 200 because the gateway omitted `Content-Type`. `isMalformed200` in `internal/singleton/singleton.go` detects the specific signature (both `200` and the malformed-header substring) and the Release path now logs Info and returns. Narrow predicate: a 502 with the same malformed-header marker is still treated as a real failure. `TestIsMalformed200` pins six cases including wrapped errors and the non-200 negative.

### Breaking
- **VM names now embed provider ID** — `omni_<requestID>` → `omni_<providerID>_<requestID>`. Prevents two providers sharing a TrueNAS host from racing on VM names. `BuildVMName` collapses any run of underscores produced by sanitization (unicode, punctuation) across both segments and trims trailing underscores, so the name is deterministic regardless of provider-id punctuation — a pre-release QA defect that produced `omni__req` / `omni___req` for empty or pure-punctuation provider IDs was fixed in this same version. See [`docs/upgrading.md#upgrading-to-v015`](https://github.com/bearbinary/omni-infra-provider-truenas/blob/main/docs/upgrading.md#upgrading-to-v015) for the migration path — existing v0.14 VMs will not be adopted; drain before upgrade or accept a cluster recreate.
- **`PROVIDER_ID` required for non-localhost `OMNI_ENDPOINT`** — fail-fast on startup otherwise. Prevents multi-tenant lease collision on the default `"truenas"` ID. `isLocalOmniEndpoint` uses boundary-aware prefix matching (next char must be `:`, `/`, `?`, `#`, end-of-string, or digit after `127.`) so a deceptive `https://localhost-attacker.example` endpoint cannot slip past the guard and suppress the PROVIDER_ID requirement — a pre-release QA defect fixed in this same version.

### Security — Critical / High
- **Deprovision ownership check** (Critical) — VM description embeds request ID; `cleanupVM` refuses VMs whose description doesn't carry the `Managed by Omni infra provider` marker. `cleanupZvol` verifies `org.omni:managed=true` and `org.omni:request-id` match before deletion. `handleExistingVM` refuses adoption of non-Omni VMs. Prevents accidental deletion after name collision or state corruption.
- **Talos extension allowlist** (High) — `extensions:` entries must appear on the built-in vetted list in [`internal/provisioner/extensions.go`](https://github.com/bearbinary/omni-infra-provider-truenas/blob/main/internal/provisioner/extensions.go) or be explicitly opted-in with `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_EXTENSIONS=true`. Structural checks (`..`, whitespace, empty string) always apply. Stops a semi-compromised MachineClass author from running arbitrary kernel modules inside Talos.
- **ISO TOFU supply-chain hash pinning** (High) — SHA-256 of every downloaded Talos ISO is recorded as a ZFS user property on the cache dataset. Subsequent downloads compare; mismatch marks the stored hash `POISONED-` and fails the provision. Protects against factory.talos.dev swap / MITM scenarios.
- **SecretString passphrase redaction in recorder** (High) — Cassettes written by `RecordingTransport` now scrub `passphrase`, `password`, `api_key`, `apikey`, `token`, `secret` anywhere a JSON field name *contains* any of those substrings. The substring form is load-bearing: a first cut used exact-match and missed the provider's own `org.omni:passphrase` property when it echoed back in a `pool.dataset.query` response — the pre-release QA pass caught it and the fix shipped in the same version. Methods whose first positional param IS the secret (`auth.login_with_api_key`, etc.) have every positional param blanked. Existing cassette `TestIntegration_AdditionalDisks_EncryptedLifecycle` scrubbed.
- **Singleton lease epoch fencing + server-time fallback** (High) — Each lease write includes a monotonically-increasing `bearbinary.com/singleton-epoch` annotation. Staleness computation falls back to COSI's server-observed `Metadata().Updated()` when the heartbeat annotation is missing, preparing for eventual client-clock-immune operation.
- **WebSocket mutex split** (Medium) — Replaces single call-mutex with a reader goroutine + per-request pending map + short-held write lock. Slow RPCs no longer cascade timeouts; `ctx` cancellation unblocks waiters immediately. New `TestWSChaos_ConcurrentCalls_DoNotSerialize` and `TestWSChaos_CtxCancelDoesNotWaitForMutex` pin the behavior.
- **`TRUENAS_HOST` validation + upload URL hardening** (Medium) — `validateHost` rejects schemes, paths, user-info, query, fragments before anything reaches the bearer-token upload path. `uploadClient.CheckRedirect` returns `http.ErrUseLastResponse` so a 3xx can't forward credentials. Upload URL built via `net/url` rather than `fmt.Sprintf`.
- **WebSocket read size cap (16 MiB)** — Malicious or compromised server frames cannot OOM the provider.
- **`filesystem.put` body via `json.Marshal`** — Hand-rolled `fmt.Sprintf %q` JSON replaced; no Unicode corner-case divergence between Go quoting and JSON.
- **`slog.Warn` on cleartext `ws://` fallback** — Loud warning when `TRUENAS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true` downgrades to cleartext. Suppressed for loopback so dev/CI is quiet.
- **SO_LINGER + bounded `Close()` deadline** — Half-open TCPs no longer wedge provider shutdown.
- **Env secret scrubbing** (Medium) — `TRUENAS_API_KEY`, `OMNI_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`, `PYROSCOPE_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` captured into local vars and then `os.Unsetenv`'d immediately. `/proc/<pid>/environ` and core dumps can no longer recover them.
- **Auth error reason scrubbing** — Long alphanumeric substrings (key-shaped) in server-returned error reasons are redacted before wrapping into Go errors.
- **`/healthz` returns generic error** — Raw TrueNAS error text (pool names, IPs) stays in server-side logs only.

### Security — Validation hardening
- `Data.Validate` rejects negative / overflow `cpus`, `memory`, `disk_size`, `storage_disk_size`; caps `additional_disks[i].size` at `MaxDiskSizeGiB` (1 PiB). Defense-in-depth against callers that bypass schema validation.

### Security — Supply chain
- **All third-party GitHub Actions pinned by full commit SHA**. Dependabot `package-ecosystem: github-actions` added to keep pins fresh. Blocks tag-move attacks on actions with `id-token: write` / `contents: write` scope.
- **`govulncheck` pinned to `@v1.1.4`** (was `@latest`).
- **Tag signature verification** in release workflow (`git tag --verify`) — require signed tags before releasing.
- **Multi-arch image smoke test** after GHCR push — pulls both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` digests and runs `--version` under QEMU.
- **`anchore/sbom-action` pinned by SHA** instead of the floating `@v0` preview channel.
- **`make generate` CI check** — regenerates protobuf-backed code in a container with pinned `protoc` + `protoc-gen-go` and fails on diff. Stops a maintainer (or compromised account) from smuggling divergent `specs.pb.go`.
- **Helm chart `image.digest` override** + cosign verification recipe documented in `docs/hardening.md`. Production deployments can pin to an immutable digest and gate rollouts on cosign-verify via Kyverno / connaisseur.
- **betterleaks allowlist tightened** — blanket `docs/**` allowlist removed; scoped to specific files only. Historical example API key entry in the baseline flagged for rotation verification.

### Docs
- **`docs/hardening.md` v0.15 security model section** — documents ISO TOFU recovery, extension allowlist override, singleton epoch, ZFS passphrase trust model (known weakness: passphrase stored on the zvol it protects, acknowledged and scheduled for KEK-wrapping in v0.16+).
- **[`docs/upgrading.md#upgrading-to-v015`](https://github.com/bearbinary/omni-infra-provider-truenas/blob/main/docs/upgrading.md#upgrading-to-v015)** — breaking-change migration guide.

### QA — Test coverage and bugs caught before release

Added ~60 new test functions across nine files during a dedicated QA pass. The new tests flushed out three real defects that were introduced earlier in this same release cycle; all three were fixed before merge.

**Defects caught and fixed:**
- **Recorder passphrase redaction was exact-match only** — fields under namespaced keys like `org.omni:passphrase` (the property the provider writes on encrypted zvols) did not match the exact-name allowlist, so passphrases echoed back in a `pool.dataset.query` response would have landed on disk in a cassette recording. Fixed by switching `sensitiveFieldNames` from `map[string]bool` to a substring list and wrapping matches in `isSensitiveFieldName`. `TestRecordingTransport_E2E_RedactsResultField` pins the repair.
- **`BuildVMName` failed to collapse underscores across the provider-id / request-id boundary** — an empty `providerID` produced `omni__req_1`; a `providerID` sanitized to pure punctuation produced `omni___req_1`. Fixed by post-concatenation `__` collapse and trailing-underscore trim in `internal/resources/meta/meta.go:27`. `TestBuildVMName_EdgeCases` covers unicode, empty, pure-punctuation, long, and legacy-prefix inputs.
- **`isLocalOmniEndpoint` bypassed by deceptive subdomain** — `https://localhost-hijacker.example` matched the `https://localhost` prefix and would have dropped the multi-tenant `PROVIDER_ID` requirement on startup. Fixed with boundary-aware prefix matching (next char must be `:`, `/`, `?`, `#`, end-of-string, or digit after `127.`). `TestIsLocalOmniEndpoint_CorrectlyRejectsDeceptiveSubdomain` pins the exact exploit vector; `TestIsLocalOmniEndpoint_TableDriven` covers the full lookup surface.

**New test files:**
- `internal/provisioner/ownership_test.go` — 13 cases: `isOmniManagedVM` nil/prefix/legacy/mid-string, `omniVMDescription` format, `verifyZvolOwnership` managed-missing / managed-false / request-id mismatch / empty-expected / legacy-zvol / read-error.
- `internal/provisioner/iso_tofu.go` + `iso_tofu_test.go` — extracted TOFU decision into `classifyTOFU` + `cachedISOPoisoned` + `poisonMarker` helpers, tested directly; plus MockClient integration test for the POISON-marker round-trip through `SetDatasetUserProperty` / `GetDatasetUserProperty`.
- `internal/provisioner/data_test.go` (additions) — `TestValidate_NumericBounds` table: negative / over-max CPUs, Memory, DiskSize, StorageDiskSize; upper-bound on `additional_disks[i].size`.
- `internal/provisioner/testhelpers_test.go` — shared `managedVM` / `managedVMWithName` / `managedVMPtr` / `managedZvolQueryResult` helpers. Existing scattered boilerplate across `chaos_test.go`, `steps_test.go`, `vm_lifecycle_test.go`, `deprovision_test.go`, `step_integration_test.go`, `upgrade_test.go` refactored to use them.
- `internal/singleton/epoch_test.go` — 11 cases: epoch starts at 1, bumps on takeover (stale / unclaimed / malformed heartbeat), preserved on re-entrant acquire, detected-under-us as stolen during Run refresh, cleared by Release, and the `leaseAge` fallback to `Metadata().Updated()` for legacy pre-v0.15 resources.
- `internal/client/ws_lifecycle_test.go` — 6 cases for the v0.15 reader goroutine + pending map: pending-entry cleanup on ctx-cancel (50 concurrent calls, assert map empty), reader exits on Close, all pending fail on conn drop, orphan response dropped silently, ctx deadline beats the 30s default, and a race-enabled concurrent-calls stress test.
- `internal/client/ws_transport_edges_test.go` — 4 cases: Close bounded on half-open TCP, `SetReadLimit` rejects oversized frames, upload `CheckRedirect` refuses 3xx + bearer not forwarded, upload body JSON-valid for Unicode paths.
- `internal/client/recorder_replay_e2e_test.go` — 8 cases: recorder end-to-end redaction of request params / response result / sensitive-method positional args; `ReplayTransport.SetStrictParams` off-by-default preserves existing cassette behavior, on-catches-mismatch, on-structural-order-insensitive; `isLoopbackHost` table covering localhost / 127.x / `[::1]` + guard against substring-match regression.
- `internal/resources/meta/meta_test.go` (additions) — 5 sub-cases: unicode, empty, invalid-only, very-long, legacy-prefix shape.
- `internal/health/health_test.go` (additions) — 4 sub-cases: pool name, internal IP, request-id UUID, VM name all scrubbed from `/healthz` response body.
- `cmd/omni-infra-provider-truenas/secret_env_test.go` — `consumeSecretEnv` unsets after read, missing-var returns empty; `isLocalOmniEndpoint` table + dedicated deceptive-subdomain guard.

**Production refactors for testability:**
- `ReplayTransport.t` changed from `*testing.T` to a narrow `testReporter` interface. Lets tests substitute a recording fake for the strict-params mismatch path without hijacking the enclosing test's failure state.
- TOFU decision logic extracted from `stepUploadISO` into package-level `classifyTOFU` / `cachedISOPoisoned` / `poisonMarker` so the decision table is unit-testable without a real HTTP server + TrueNAS mock.

Full suite (including `-race`) passes. `make lint` is clean.



## [v0.14.7] — Empirically-verified API key setup, hardening guide, metrics-server docs, regression guards

### Security / Documentation
- **Rewrite API key setup after empirical verification against TrueNAS 25.10.1** — Prior docs told users to create the API key under **Credentials > Local Users > root > API Keys**, which ties the provider's audit trail to interactive root activity and can't be revoked without affecting root login. An earlier attempt (also in Unreleased) recommended a scoped-roles custom privilege with 13 roles instead; that recommendation was based on partial information and **does not actually work** because the Talos ISO upload endpoint (`/_upload`) enforces the `SYS_ADMIN` account attribute on top of the role system, and `SYS_ADMIN` is granted only via `builtin_administrators` group membership. Replaced with the verified-working recipe: dedicated non-root user + `builtin_administrators` group membership. All doc surfaces updated (`README.md`, `AGENT.md`, `docs/truenas-setup.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/index.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`, `llms-full.txt`, `.env.example`, `deploy/docker-compose.yaml`). The new `docs/truenas-setup.md#5-api-key` documents the empirical findings including why scoped privileges alone don't work, with cross-links to the two upstream bug reports.

### Documentation
- **New `docs/hardening.md`** — Practical security hardening guide for the provider, organized as eight rungs from highest-feasibility-today to aspirational. Covers: dedicated non-root TrueNAS user (with the `builtin_administrators` requirement explained), API key rotation flow, scoped privilege caveats with cross-link to the upstream bug, network-level controls (management VLAN, firewall allow-list), secret storage for Kubernetes / Docker Compose / standalone, TLS hygiene, audit log + Prometheus alert ingestion, and per-zvol ZFS encryption. Includes a Mermaid threat model diagram, a `SecurityContext` snippet for Kubernetes, a `security_opt` snippet for Compose, a cosign verification one-liner, and a printable hardening checklist. Linked from `docs/truenas-setup.md` and added to mkdocs nav under Operations.
- **Metrics Server guide for Talos clusters** — New `docs/getting-started.md` Step 7 (plus pointer from Step 4) and matching blocks in `AGENT.md`, `llms-full.txt`, and `llms.txt` document the Talos-specific install recipe: cluster config patch `machine.kubelet.extraArgs.rotate-server-certificates: true` plus the `kubelet-serving-cert-approver` and `metrics-server` manifests delivered via Omni Extra Manifests. Covers both bootstrap-at-cluster-creation (preferred) and patch-existing-cluster paths. Follows the upstream Sidero guide.
- **Grafana dashboard marketplace descriptions** — New `deploy/observability/dashboards/README.md` with ready-to-submit entries (Name, Summary, Description, Panels, Tags, Required data sources) for the four bundled dashboards: Overview, VM Provisioning, TrueNAS API Performance, and Cleanup & Maintenance. Intended as the Description field when uploading to grafana.com/grafana/dashboards.

### Tools
- **`scripts/verify-api-key-roles`** — New Go probe that exercises every JSON-RPC method and the `/_upload` endpoint the provider calls, using an API key you supply, and prints a pass/fail matrix for the 13 recommended roles (or `FULL_ADMIN`). The probe creates and tears down a throw-away dataset, 1 MB test zvol, and a stopped test VM — no persistent state on success, no VMs are started, no existing data is touched. Lets operators verify a scoped privilege *before* assigning it to the provider. Cross-referenced from `docs/truenas-setup.md` and `docs/hardening.md`.

### Upstream bug reports
- **`docs/upstream-bugs/truenas-role-recursion.md` (NEW)** — TrueNAS 25.10.1 `middlewared/role.py:362-363` has no cycle detection in `RoleManager.roles_for_role()`. Saving a custom privilege with a meta-role (e.g. `FULL_ADMIN`, `READONLY_ADMIN`, `FILESYSTEM_FULL_CONTROL`) alongside its transitively-included child roles triggers `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded` on every subsequent `auth.login_*` call for any user bound to that privilege. Middleware restart doesn't fix it because the bad privilege is persisted in the config DB. Recovery requires editing the privilege via `midclt` from another admin account. Report includes full stack trace, minimal reproduction, proposed fix (visited-set guard), and user-side workarounds. File this upstream at iXsystems.
- **`docs/upstream-bugs/truenas-upload-role-gap.md` (NEW)** — TrueNAS 25.10.1 `/_upload` HTTP endpoint ignores `FILESYSTEM_DATA_WRITE` role and returns HTTP 403 unless the user is in `builtin_administrators`. Inconsistent with the JSON-RPC `filesystem.put` method which the role is documented to cover. Report includes a pass/fail matrix showing every other filesystem operation authorized by the same roles succeeding for the same user, `auth.me` diff between working (admin) and failing (scoped) users isolating `SYS_ADMIN` as the only differing attribute, reproduction script path, and proposed fix options. File this upstream at iXsystems.

### Tests
- **Regression guards** — New tests pinning invariants that were found missing during the v0.14.3–v0.14.6 investigation. `TestCreateConfigPatch_AlwaysUsesPatchNameHelper` (AST walk failing any bare-string-literal `CreateConfigPatch` call), `TestStepCreateVM_WiresAllExpectedPatches` (4 patch kinds present in `stepCreateVM`), `TestDefaultExtensions_RequiredEntries` (`iscsi-tools`/`util-linux-tools`/`qemu-guest-agent`), `TestBuildOTLPExporters_ProtocolSelection` (4 cases covering gRPC/HTTP selection), `TestBuildOTLPExporters_UnsupportedProtocolFailsFast`, `TestBuildHTTPExporters_UsesSignalEndpointWiring` (source-grep that `signalEndpoint` is actually called), `TestChangelog_VersionEntriesUseBracketFormat` (release-workflow awk extractor compat), `TestChangelog_EveryVersionHasReferenceLink`, `TestEnvDefaults_SafetyCriticalSettings` (6 sub-cases: `PROVIDER_SINGLETON_ENABLED=true`, `TRUENAS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=false`, `OMNI_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=false`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc`, `GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=30`, `MAX_ERROR_RECOVERIES=5`).

### CI
- **Release workflow asserts Dockerfile + image invariants** — New "Verify image and Dockerfile invariants" step between smoke test and multi-arch push: asserts `Config.User == 65534:65534` on the built image (catches silent base-image default drift), and greps `Dockerfile` for `COPY --chmod=0755` and `^USER 65534:65534` (catches refactor drift that the runtime smoke test alone wouldn't detect in isolation). Any drift fails the build before anything reaches GHCR.

## [v0.14.6] — Fix every storage-side gap that made Longhorn silently broken

> **Storage-side hardening release.** Three independent bugs in v0.13.0–v0.14.5 left users with non-functional or silently-broken Longhorn deployments. This release fixes all three plus adds the Talos-side operational config the `install-longhorn.sh` script used to apply, so `storage_disk_size: 100` in a MachineClass is now sufficient for a Longhorn-ready worker. **Migration required for any existing cluster** — see end of entry.

### Fixes
- **Drop `maxSize: 0` from emitted `UserVolumeConfig`** — The patch builder added in v0.14.3 emitted `maxSize: 0` intending "unbounded", but Talos parses 0 as a literal byte count and rejects the document with `UserVolumeConfig/longhorn: min size is greater than max size`. Any worker that received the patch was stuck at Talos `stage: 3` with `configuptodate: false` and never finished joining the cluster. Per Talos v1.12 docs, the correct way to express "fill the disk" is to **omit** `maxSize` and rely on `grow: true`. Fixed in `buildUserVolumePatch`. Pinned by `TestBuildUserVolumePatch_SingleDisk_Longhorn` (now also asserts `maxSize` is absent from the YAML).
- **Fix `CreateConfigPatch` name collision across `MachineRequests`** — The Omni SDK's `provision.Context.CreateConfigPatch(ctx, name, data)` uses the literal `name` as the resource ID and upserts on every call. Every MachineRequest reconciling with the same unqualified name (e.g. `"data-volumes"`) wrote to the SAME `ConfigPatchRequest` resource — last writer wins, the other 5 of 6 machines silently went without their patch. Verified on a real cluster: 6 MachineRequests, 1 surviving `data-volumes` ConfigPatchRequest labeled for whichever request reconciled last. Same bug applied to `nic-mtu` and `advertised-subnets` patches. Fixed by introducing `patchName(kind, requestID)` helper and threading the request ID into all 4 call sites in `stepCreateVM`. Pinned by `TestPatchName_IncludesRequestID`, `TestPatchName_DistinctAcrossRequests`, `TestPatchName_DistinctAcrossKinds`.
- **Auto-emit Longhorn operational patch when a disk is named `longhorn`** — From v0.13.0 to v0.14.5 the provider attached the Longhorn data disk and (from v0.14.3) mounted it at `/var/mnt/longhorn`, but the **Talos-side bits** that make the node Longhorn-ready had to be applied by `scripts/install-longhorn.sh` — which most users either forgot to run or ran with the broken self-bind from v0.13.0–v0.14.2. The provider now emits a `longhorn-ops-<requestID>` patch alongside the `UserVolumeConfig` whenever any disk is named `longhorn` (set implicitly by `storage_disk_size`, explicitly by `additional_disks: [{name: longhorn, ...}]`). The patch loads the `iscsi_tcp` kernel module (without it, Longhorn iSCSI replica attachment fails and PVCs stay Pending forever), binds `/var/mnt/longhorn` → `/var/lib/longhorn` with `bind,rshared,rw` (without it, Longhorn writes replicas to Talos's ephemeral root partition — silent data loss on node replace), and sets `vm.overcommit_memory: "1"` (recommended for replica process stability). After v0.14.6, `helm install longhorn` is the only remaining user step. Pinned by 5 new test cases asserting source≠destination on the bind mount, `rshared` option present, `iscsi_tcp` module loaded, `vm.overcommit_memory=1` set, and `LonghornVolumeName` constant equals `"longhorn"`.

### Migration

Existing clusters provisioned on v0.13.0–v0.14.5 need cleanup before v0.14.6 starts emitting the new patches:

```bash
# 1. Delete the stuck data-volumes ConfigPatchRequest (collision artifact, has bad maxSize:0)
omnictl delete configpatchrequest data-volumes --namespace=infra-provider

# 2. If you have a manual Longhorn patch (e.g. longhorn-data-disk), delete it —
#    the provider now emits an equivalent patch automatically.
#    Two UserVolumeConfigs both named "longhorn" applied to the same machine
#    will be rejected by Talos.
omnictl delete configpatch longhorn-data-disk

# 3. Reprovision worker VMs so they pick up the per-request patches and the
#    operational patch on first boot. Easiest path: scale the worker
#    MachineRequestSet down to 0 then back up to N.

# 4. After workers come back up, install/upgrade Longhorn via Helm.
#    scripts/install-longhorn.sh is now optional — it still works (the Talos
#    patch it applies is a superset of what the provider emits, so it's a
#    no-op merge), but the only step that matters going forward is the Helm
#    install itself.
helm install longhorn longhorn/longhorn -n longhorn-system --create-namespace \
  --set defaultSettings.defaultDataPath=/var/lib/longhorn
```

## [v0.14.5] — Fix Grafana Cloud OTLP 404s (for real this time) + run as uid 65534

### Fixes
- **Fix OTLP 404s on Grafana Cloud (the v0.14.1 fix was wrong)** — v0.14.1 claimed to honor `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf` by forwarding `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` through `otlptracehttp.WithEndpointURL(url)`, under the (incorrect) assumption that the SDK would append `/v1/traces`, `/v1/metrics`, `/v1/logs` to the path. It doesn't: `WithEndpointURL` in the Go OTEL SDK uses the URL path **verbatim** — it implements the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` per-signal-URL semantic, not the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` base-URL semantic. So when a user set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otlp-gateway-prod-us-east-3.grafana.net/otlp`, every OTLP request went to `.../otlp` (no signal suffix) and Grafana Cloud returned `404 Not Found`. Observed as repeating `failed to send logs to https://.../otlp: 404 Not Found` / `traces export: ... 404` lines with no telemetry reaching the gateway. Fixed by introducing `signalEndpoint(base, "/v1/<signal>")` that appends the per-signal path before calling `WithEndpointURL`. Covered by `TestSignalEndpoint_AppendsPath` (6 cases including Grafana Cloud base URL, trailing slash, host-only, root path, and invalid-URL fallback) and `TestSignalEndpoint_InvalidURL_PassesThrough`.

### Behavior Changes
- **Container runs as uid/gid 65534 (`nobody`) instead of 65532** — The Dockerfile now sets `USER 65534:65534` explicitly, overriding the distroless `:nonroot` tag's default uid 65532. On TrueNAS hosts, `nobody` is uid 65534 by default, so bind-mounted volumes from the host now align with the container user without needing a `chown`. Container-only installs (pure Docker Compose, Kubernetes PVCs) are unaffected as long as volume ownership matches 65534 (most default volume-plugins create volumes owned by the container's uid). **Manual migration may be required** for existing deployments where volumes were pre-created and chown'd to 65532 (the old default): either `chown -R 65534:65534 <volume-path>` on the host, or override with `docker run --user 65532:65532` to keep the old behavior. The binary is statically linked Go — no username lookups — so the fact that uid 65534 has no `/etc/passwd` entry in the distroless image is harmless.

## [v0.14.4] — Fix container permission denied + add image smoke test; yank v0.14.3

> **v0.14.4 = v0.14.3 + permission-denied fix + pipeline smoke test.** All of v0.14.3's fixes ship here (UserVolumeConfig auto-emission for additional disks, `install-longhorn.sh` bind-mount correction) — the v0.14.3 release was yanked because its Docker image failed to start. Upgrading from v0.14.2 to v0.14.4 gives you every v0.14.3 fix plus a working binary. See the v0.14.3 entry below for the full storage fix details.

### Fixes
- **Fix `exec: permission denied` on container startup (v0.14.1–v0.14.3 images are broken)** — The parallelize-builds refactor in v0.14.1 introduced a silent regression: `actions/upload-artifact@v4` packages files as ZIP and strips the execute bit on upload; `actions/download-artifact@v4` restores them without `+x`. The Dockerfile's `COPY` then preserved the zero-permission file, so every Docker image published for v0.14.1, v0.14.2, and v0.14.3 fails immediately on startup with `OCI runtime create failed: exec: "/usr/local/bin/omni-infra-provider-truenas": permission denied`. Two-part fix: **(1)** Dockerfile now uses `COPY --chmod=0755` to set the execute bit at build time regardless of source file mode, and **(2)** the release workflow runs `chmod +x _out/omni-infra-provider-truenas-*` right after `download-artifact` so the signed binaries uploaded to the release page are also directly executable for users downloading them outside the container. **Users on v0.14.1–v0.14.3 must upgrade to v0.14.4.** Pinning to `v0.13.x` also works as a fallback (pre-regression), but v0.13.x is missing the v0.14.x fixes (WebSocket-only transport, Longhorn iscsi-tools extension, OTEL protocol honoring, boot-order fix, UserVolumeConfig auto-emission).

### CI
- **Add image smoke test to the release pipeline** — New step in the release workflow builds the image for `linux/amd64` into the local Docker daemon *before* the multi-arch push, then runs `docker run --rm smoke-test:<tag> --version` and asserts the output matches the tag. A broken binary (missing execute bit, corrupted cross-compile, failed `ldflags`) fails the workflow before anything reaches GHCR, cosign, or the GitHub release page. The multi-arch push only runs if the smoke test passes, so users cannot pull a broken image even transiently. Also adds a `--version` / `-v` / `version` flag to the CLI itself (prints version and exits 0) — separate from `run()` so no Omni/TrueNAS config is required, which makes it safe to invoke from CI with no env.

## [v0.14.3] — Fix additional disks never reaching Talos (Longhorn was running on the root disk) — YANKED

> ⚠️ **Yanked — do not use v0.14.3.** The published Docker image fails at startup with `OCI runtime create failed: exec: "/usr/local/bin/omni-infra-provider-truenas": permission denied` because `actions/upload-artifact` stripped the execute bit from the compiled binary. The same regression affects v0.14.1 and v0.14.2 images. The GitHub Release page for v0.14.3 has been removed; users on v0.14.3 (or v0.14.1/v0.14.2) should upgrade to **v0.14.4**, which carries all v0.14.3 fixes plus the permission-denied repair and a pipeline smoke test that prevents this class of regression.

### Fixes
- **Auto-emit Talos `UserVolumeConfig` for additional disks** — Setting `additional_disks` (or the `storage_disk_size` shorthand) attached the disk as a VM device on TrueNAS but never emitted the Talos config patch needed to format and mount it inside the guest. The disk showed up as a raw unformatted block device (`/dev/vdb`, `/dev/vdc`, ...) invisible to Longhorn, local-path-provisioner, and every other Kubernetes storage driver. Users had to apply a custom `UserVolumeConfig` patch manually for every MachineClass. Fixed by emitting a `UserVolumeConfig` patch per additional disk in `stepCreateVM` — filesystem `xfs` (default) or `ext4`, mounted at `/var/mnt/<name>`, with a CEL selector keyed to each zvol's exact byte-size (±1 MiB tolerance for block-alignment) so multiple same-sized disks assign 1:1 to volumes in discovery order. Two new `AdditionalDisk` fields: `name` (defaults to `data-N`, 1-indexed) and `filesystem` (defaults to `xfs`). `storage_disk_size` expansion now auto-sets `name: longhorn` so the volume mounts at `/var/mnt/longhorn` to match Longhorn's `defaultDataPath`. Validation rejects duplicate volume names (two disks can't mount at the same path) and unknown filesystems. Added `TestBuildUserVolumePatch_*`, `TestStorageDiskSize_ExpandsWithLonghornVolumeName`, `TestAdditionalDisks_DefaultsFillNameAndFilesystem`, and three new validation tests.
- **Fix `install-longhorn.sh` bind mount — Longhorn was silently running on the ephemeral root disk** — The Talos config patch in `scripts/install-longhorn.sh` declared `source: /var/lib/longhorn` and `destination: /var/lib/longhorn`: a self-bind that was effectively a no-op. It exposed the path under Talos's read-only `/var` overlay without mounting the attached data disk, so Longhorn has been writing replica data to Talos's ephemeral root partition instead of the `storage_disk_size` zvol since v0.13.0. Every `storage_disk_size` zvol on every existing Longhorn cluster has been attached, unformatted, and unused for two releases. Fixed to `source: /var/mnt/longhorn` to bind the provider's now-auto-emitted `UserVolumeConfig` mount into the path Longhorn's pods expect. Combined with the `UserVolumeConfig` auto-emission above, new clusters provisioned on this release get Longhorn running on the intended data disk out of the box. **Existing clusters need to re-run the script (idempotent — the config patch gets replaced) _after_ reprovisioning their worker VMs on this release** so the UserVolumeConfig mount exists before the bind references it. Migrating data off the ephemeral root is Longhorn's problem: drain replicas to new nodes, remove old nodes, rebalance.

## [v0.14.2] — Fix UEFI boot order trapping Talos in halt_if_installed

### Fixes
- **Boot order: root disk before CDROM** — Provisioned VMs set CDROM `order=1000` and root disk `order=1001`, which in bhyve's UEFI boot manager means "CDROM first, disk second". The initial install worked because Talos installs from the ISO, reboots, and the disk then has a bootloader — but any subsequent reboot where UEFI re-entered the CDROM caused the VM to halt with `task haltIfInstalled: Talos is already installed to disk but booted from another media and talos.halt_if_installed kernel parameter is set`. Re-ordered to root disk `1000`, additional disks `1001+`, CDROM `1500`, NIC `2001`. Now UEFI tries the disk first and only falls through to the CDROM on a fresh VM where the disk is empty. Added `TestBootOrder_DiskBeforeCDROM` to pin the invariant. **Migration required for VMs provisioned on v0.14.1 or earlier** — bump each CDROM's `order` from `1000` to `1500` (TrueNAS UI: VM → Devices → CDROM → Device Order; or `midclt call vm.device.update <id> '{"order": 1500}'`). New VMs provisioned on v0.14.2 and later are unaffected. See [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/bearbinary/omni-infra-provider-truenas/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#vm-halts-on-reboot-with-talos-is-already-installed-to-disk-but-booted-from-another-media) and [Upgrading](https://github.com/bearbinary/omni-infra-provider-truenas/blob/main/docs/upgrading.md#upgrading-to-the-boot-order-fix-v0142).

### Removed
- **TrueNAS app catalog packaging** — Deleted the `truenas-app/` directory (app.yaml, questions.yaml, ix_values.yaml, docker-compose template, migrations stub). The provider is no longer being submitted to the TrueNAS community apps catalog. Installation on TrueNAS is still supported via **Apps > Discover > Install via YAML** with the compose YAML documented in `README.md` and `docs/quickstart.md` — the removed files were only used for catalog-format submission. Affected doc language was updated from "TrueNAS App (Recommended)" to "Docker Compose on TrueNAS (Recommended)" in `README.md`, `docs/index.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, `AGENT.md`, `llms.txt`, and `llms-full.txt`. Bug report template's deployment-method field updated accordingly.

### Documentation
- **New control plane sizing guide** (`docs/sizing.md`) — When to bump CP VM resources, with concrete observable triggers (apiserver p99 > 1s, etcd `apply request took too long` warnings, kube-apiserver OOMKilled, `kubectl top` CPU/mem > 70% sustained, etcd DB > 2 GiB, heavy operator installs like ArgoCD / Crossplane / service meshes). Includes a sizing table from homelab (2 vCPU / 2 GiB) up to 50+ node clusters, an HA rolling-replace procedure (drain → delete → scale up → repeat) with a Mermaid sequence diagram, single-CP in-place resize via `midclt`, and a note that etcd fsync latency is a ZFS/SLOG problem — bumping CPU/RAM won't fix it. Linked from `index.md`, `getting-started.md`, `quickstart.md` MachineClass config table, and mkdocs nav under Operations.

### CI
- **Restore Grafana dashboards + alert rules as release assets** — The parallelize-builds refactor in v0.14.1 inadvertently dropped the dashboard bundling step added for v0.14.0 discoverability. Re-added: the release workflow now uploads `overview.json`, `provisioning.json`, `api-performance.json`, `cleanup.json`, a combined `grafana-dashboards.zip`, and `truenas-provider.rules.yml` as release assets on every tag. Users can grab them directly from the GitHub release page for import into Grafana Cloud / self-hosted.

## [v0.14.1] — Fix OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL for Grafana Cloud

### Fixes
- **Honor `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf`** — The `OTELProtocol` config field was declared but `initOTEL` only wired up the gRPC exporters, so setting `http/protobuf` silently fell back to gRPC. When users pointed `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` at a Grafana Cloud OTLP gateway URL (`https://otlp-gateway-...grafana.net/otlp`), the gRPC name resolver rejected the `https://` scheme and logged `failed to upload metrics: exporter export timeout: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = name resolver error: produced zero addresses` on repeat. Fixed by branching on `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`: `grpc` (default) uses the existing gRPC exporters; `http/protobuf` (or `http`) uses the OTLP/HTTP exporters via `WithEndpointURL`, which accepts full URLs and appends `/v1/traces`, `/v1/metrics`, `/v1/logs` to the base path as the spec requires. Unknown protocol values now fail fast with a clear error instead of silently defaulting.

### Internal
- Update Grafana dashboard title assertions in `TestGrafanaDashboards_ValidJSON` to match the grafana.com-ready names shipped in v0.14.0.
- Add multi-size logo assets (128/256/512) for grafana.com plugin catalog upload.

## [v0.14.0] — WebSocket-Only Transport, Longhorn Default

### Breaking / Behavior Changes
- **Drop Unix socket transport — WebSocket + API key required** — TrueNAS 25.10 removed implicit authentication on the `middlewared.sock` Unix socket. Every JSON-RPC call now returns `ENOTAUTHENTICATED` unless the client has authenticated first, which means the "zero-auth Unix socket" path is no longer possible. The transport auto-detection logic, the `socketTransport`, `TRUENAS_SOCKET_PATH` env var, and the socket mount have all been removed. `TRUENAS_HOST` and `TRUENAS_API_KEY` are now required in all deployments. When running as a TrueNAS app, set `TRUENAS_HOST=localhost` and `TRUENAS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true`.

### Features
- **Console OTEL exporters (opt-in)** — Set `OTEL_CONSOLE_EXPORT=true` to emit traces, metrics, and logs to stdout in addition to the configured gRPC endpoint. Off by default to avoid log spam in production. Traces and logs use pretty-printed JSON; metrics print every 60s. Useful for local debugging without wiring up a collector.
- **Startup log includes TrueNAS host and TLS verify status** — The `TrueNAS client connected` log line now shows `host=<truenas-host>` and `tls_verify=<bool>` to make misconfiguration easier to spot.
- **Add `siderolabs/iscsi-tools` to default extensions** — Longhorn (the default storage) uses iSCSI internally to attach replicas to pods. Previously users had to manually add `iscsi-tools` to their MachineClass `extensions` list or PVCs would sit in Pending forever. Now it's baked in alongside `qemu-guest-agent` and `util-linux-tools`.
- **Longhorn install script loads `iscsi_tcp` kernel module** — `scripts/install-longhorn.sh` now includes `machine.kernel.modules: [iscsi_tcp]` in the Talos config patch. Required for Longhorn to establish iSCSI sessions between replicas and pods.

### Removed
- `socketTransport` implementation and all Unix-socket-specific code paths
- `TRUENAS_SOCKET_PATH` environment variable
- `SocketPath` field on `client.Config`
- Unix socket host mount from the TrueNAS app definition
- **`siderolabs/nfs-utils` from default Talos extensions** — the provider no longer manages NFS storage, so the NFS client is no longer needed in every VM. Users who want democratic-csi NFS mode or manual NFS mounts can add `siderolabs/nfs-utils` to their MachineClass `extensions` field.

### CI
- **Parallelize release binary builds via matrix strategy** — Release workflow now cross-compiles the four target platforms (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`) on separate runners in parallel via GitHub Actions `strategy.matrix`, instead of sequentially on a single runner. Each matrix job uploads its binary as an artifact; the release job downloads all four before signing and publishing. Cuts wall-clock time on the build stage roughly 4x.
- **Drop duplicate compile in release gate** — The `test` job in `release.yaml` no longer runs `make build`. `go test` already compiles the packages, so the separate build step was pure duplication. Saves ~30s per release.

## [v0.13.2] — Fix Unix Socket Transport for TrueNAS 25.10 (SUPERSEDED — use v0.14.0+)

> ⚠️ **KNOWN BROKEN.** The Unix socket fix in v0.13.2 was incomplete. TrueNAS 25.10's middleware requires authentication on every JSON-RPC call, so the "zero-auth Unix socket" path is no longer viable. Upgrade to v0.14.0, which uses WebSocket with mandatory API key authentication.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix Unix socket transport for TrueNAS 25.10+** — TrueNAS 25.10 (Goldeye) changed the middleware Unix socket from raw JSON-RPC to JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket. The provider now uses WebSocket-over-Unix with pure JSON-RPC 2.0 framing (no DDP handshake), matching `midclt`'s `JSONRPCClient`. Without this fix, the provider crash-loops with `invalid character 'H' looking for beginning of value` or `i/o timeout` when deployed as a TrueNAS app.

### CI
- **Eliminate QEMU from Docker builds** — The Dockerfile no longer compiles Go inside the container. Pre-built binaries from Go's native cross-compilation are `COPY`ed directly into distroless, removing the QEMU emulation bottleneck for arm64. Release builds that took 10+ minutes now complete in under 30 seconds.

### Housekeeping
- Remove unused raw JSON-RPC request/response types (superseded by WebSocket protocol)
- Add reconnect with exponential backoff to Unix socket transport (matches WebSocket transport behavior)

## [v0.13.1] — Grafana Cloud Observability

> ⚠️ **Incompatible with TrueNAS SCALE 25.10 (Goldeye).** Upgrade to [v0.14.0](#v0140--websocket-only-transport-longhorn-default) if you're on 25.10+.

### Features
- **Grafana Cloud observability support** — OTEL exporters now accept `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` for authenticated endpoints (e.g., Grafana Cloud OTLP gateway). Pyroscope client supports `PYROSCOPE_BASIC_AUTH_USER` and `PYROSCOPE_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` for Grafana Cloud Profiles. Both local dev stacks and Grafana Cloud work with the same provider binary — just different env vars.

### Housekeeping
- Reserve removed proto field `nfs_dataset_path` (field 10) to prevent accidental reuse
- Remove stale `configureStorage` and NFS panels from Grafana provisioning dashboard

## [v0.13.0] — Multi-Disk VMs, Singleton Lease, Deterministic MACs, Circuit Breaker & Storage

> ⚠️ **Incompatible with TrueNAS SCALE 25.10 (Goldeye).** Upgrade to [v0.14.0](#v0140--websocket-only-transport-longhorn-default) if you're on 25.10+.

### Breaking / Behavior Changes
- **Longhorn is now the only supported storage path** — NFS auto-storage has been fully removed (see Removed section below). Add a dedicated data disk via `storage_disk_size` in your MachineClass, then install Longhorn via Helm. See [`docs/storage.md`](storage.md) for setup steps.
- **Deterministic MAC addresses are now always on for additional NICs** — the per-NIC `deterministic_mac` opt-in field on `additional_nics` has been removed. All NICs (primary and additional) now unconditionally receive a stable MAC derived from the machine request ID so DHCP reservations survive reprovisioning on every interface, not just the primary. Existing `MachineClass` configs with `deterministic_mac: true` still work (the field is silently ignored via unknown-field warning); configs with `deterministic_mac: false` will start getting deterministic MACs on next reprovision.

### Bug Fixes
- **Drop `mtu` from NIC device create** — TrueNAS 25.10 rejects `mtu` on `vm.device.create` with `[EINVAL] vm_device_create.attributes.NIC.mtu: Extra inputs are not permitted`, which blocked provisioning of any additional NIC whose MachineClass set an `mtu` value (typical for jumbo-frame storage networks). `NICConfig.MTU` is now ignored on the hypervisor call — MTU is still applied inside the guest via the existing MAC-matched Talos config patch (`buildMTUPatch`), which is the correct layer for it. Same shape as the v0.12.0 `vlan` attribute removal.

### Features
- **Singleton enforcement via distributed lease** — The provider now claims an exclusive lease on startup via annotations on the `infra.ProviderStatus` resource, preventing two processes with the same `PROVIDER_ID` from racing on VM creation, zvol creation, and ISO upload. The Omni SDK has no built-in leader election, so two instances with the same ID would both receive every `MachineRequest` and execute provisioning steps concurrently against TrueNAS — typically resulting in duplicate VM names, failed zvol creates, and half-provisioned machines. The lease fails fast when a fresh heartbeat is observed from another instance (surfacing duplicate-provider misconfigurations loudly) and takes over automatically when the prior holder is ungracefully killed and its heartbeat goes stale (default: 45s). Opt-out via `PROVIDER_SINGLETON_ENABLED=false` for debugging or advanced sharding. Tunable via `PROVIDER_SINGLETON_REFRESH_INTERVAL` (default 15s) and `PROVIDER_SINGLETON_STALE_AFTER` (default 45s). See `docs/architecture.md#singleton-enforcement` and `docs/troubleshooting.md` for operational details. Kubernetes rolling deploys should use `strategy.type=Recreate` or `maxSurge=0` to avoid overlap windows.
- **Additional disk support (multi-disk VMs)** — Attach extra data disks beyond the root disk via `additional_disks` in MachineClass config. Each disk can target a different ZFS pool and independently toggle encryption. Enables dedicated etcd disks on fast SSD pools, bulk data disks on HDD pools, and is a prerequisite for node-local distributed storage (Longhorn). Max 16 additional disks per VM. Paths tracked in protobuf state for automatic cleanup on deprovision.
- **Additional disk resize** — Additional disks grow automatically when the `size` in `additional_disks` config increases, matching the root disk resize behavior. Shrinking is prevented (ZFS limitation).
- **`storage_disk_size` convenience field** — New MachineClass schema field that adds a dedicated data disk for persistent storage (Longhorn). Setting `storage_disk_size: 100` is equivalent to `additional_disks: [{size: 100}]` but simpler in the Omni UI.
- **MTU / jumbo frames for additional NICs** — Optional `mtu` field on `additional_nics` items. Applied as a Talos machine config patch using MAC-based interface matching. Set to 9000 for jumbo frames on storage networks.
- **Deterministic MAC addresses** — All NICs (primary and additional) get a stable MAC derived from the machine request ID, so DHCP reservations survive reprovision. Collision detection queries the same network segment before attaching.
- **Node auto-replace circuit breaker** — VMs stuck in ERROR state are automatically deprovisioned after exceeding `MAX_ERROR_RECOVERIES` (default: 5) consecutive failed recoveries. Omni's reconciliation loop then provisions a fresh replacement. Configurable via env var; set to `-1` to disable.
- **Longhorn install script** — `scripts/install-longhorn.sh <cluster>` one-command Longhorn setup: applies Talos config patch via omnictl, Helm installs Longhorn, sets default StorageClass, verifies with test PVC. Idempotent.

### Observability
- Add `truenas.vms.auto_replaced` metric — counts VMs deprovisioned by the circuit breaker
- Add ”VMs Auto-Replaced” stat panel to provisioning Grafana dashboard
- Add `TrueNASVMAutoReplaced` Prometheus alert rule — fires when circuit breaker triggers, severity: warning

### Removed
- **Remove NFS auto-storage** — The `configureStorage` provision step, `auto_storage` MachineClass field, `AUTO_STORAGE_ENABLED` / `NFS_HOST` env vars, NFS client methods (`CreateNFSShare`, `GetNFSShareByPath`, `DeleteNFSShare`, `EnsureNFSService`, `SetDatasetPermissions`), NFS config patch builder, and all related tests have been fully removed. NFS had too many issues in Kubernetes: networking complexity (port 2049 reachability, firewall rules), broad application incompatibility (PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and any WAL/Raft-based system corrupt data on NFS), no support for Kubernetes-native VolumeSnapshots, and the underlying provisioner (nfs-subdir-external-provisioner) has been unmaintained since 2022. Use Longhorn with `storage_disk_size` instead — it's self-contained, supports snapshots, and works in any network topology.
- **Remove ZFS snapshot/rollback code** — Talos nodes are immutable; the correct recovery path is to replace a failed VM (Omni reprovisions automatically), not to roll back a zvol. Removed: `CreateSnapshot`, `ListSnapshots`, `DeleteSnapshot`, `RollbackSnapshot` client methods, `snapshotBeforeUpgrade` and `enforceSnapshotRetention` provisioner logic, `last_upgrade_snapshot` protobuf field, snapshot telemetry counters, and all related tests. The `Snapshot` type and pre-upgrade snapshot workflow introduced in v0.6.0–v0.8.0 are fully removed.

### Documentation
- Rewrite storage guide (`docs/storage.md`) — Longhorn as recommended default, NFS removed as provider-managed option, democratic-csi as advanced alternative
- Add Velero CSI snapshot integration to backup guide (`docs/backup.md`) — VolumeSnapshotClass setup for Longhorn and democratic-csi, CSI Snapshot Data Movement for off-site S3
- Add disaster recovery runbook to backup guide — 5 scenarios with step-by-step procedures and recovery time table
- Add backup & disaster recovery guide (`docs/backup.md`) — control plane backup via Omni, workload/PVC backup via Velero to remote S3
- Add jumbo frames / MTU guide to networking docs (`docs/networking.md`)
- Remove snapshot rollback documentation from upgrading guide

## [v0.12.0] — VM Identity Fix, Per-Zvol Encryption, Health Endpoint & Hardening

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix VM identity duplication** — VMs now get a provider-generated SMBIOS UUID passed to `vm.create`, ensuring the bhyve UUID matches what the provider reports to Omni. Previously, bhyve assigned a random UUID causing Talos to register as a separate machine, resulting in ghost "Provisioned/Waiting" entries alongside the real nodes.
- Fix pool free space reporting — now queries root dataset (`pool.dataset.query`) for usable space that matches TrueNAS UI, instead of raw pool stats that ignore ZFS overhead/parity/metadata.
- Fix ZFS encryption API compatibility — use `AES-256-GCM` (uppercase) and set `inherit_encryption: false` for TrueNAS 25.04+ compatibility.
- Fix `UserProperties` format — use list-of-objects (`[{key, value}]`) instead of map for TrueNAS 25.10+ compatibility.
- Fix pool validation errors — suggest `dataset_prefix` when user passes a dataset path as pool name.
- Fix `checkExistingVM` — reset `CdromDeviceId` alongside `VmId` when VM is deleted externally.
- Keep CDROM attached after provisioning — removing it required stopping the VM, which killed Talos mid-install. CDROM is now cleaned up only on deprovision.
- Remove `vlan` attribute from NIC device creation — TrueNAS 25.10 rejects VM-level VLAN tagging via `vm.device.create`. VLAN tagging is handled at the host level by attaching to VLAN interfaces (e.g., `vlan666`)
- Switch UUID generation from hand-rolled v4 to `google/uuid` v7
- **Fix orphan cleanup deleting all VMs after provider restart** — replaced in-memory VM tracking (lost on restart) with TrueNAS state queries. Orphan VMs are now detected by checking if their backing zvol (tagged with `org.omni:managed`) still exists. Orphan zvols are detected by checking if their corresponding VM still exists. No in-memory state needed — safe across restarts

### Features
- Add multiple NIC support via `additional_nics` in MachineClass config
- Add `advertised_subnets` config patch support — automatically generates and applies Talos machine config patches for etcd `advertisedSubnets` and kubelet `nodeIP.validSubnets` when set in MachineClass config
- Auto-detect primary NIC subnet when `advertised_subnets` is not set but additional NICs are configured — queries TrueNAS `interface.query` for the primary NIC's IPv4 CIDR and applies the config patch automatically
- Add per-zvol auto-generated encryption passphrases — replaces global `ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE` env var. Each encrypted zvol gets a unique cryptographically random passphrase stored as a ZFS user property (`org.omni:passphrase`), enabling auto-unlock after TrueNAS reboots without a shared secret.
- Add graceful VM shutdown on deprovision (ACPI signal with configurable timeout before force-stop)
- Add HTTP health endpoint (`/healthz`, `/readyz`) for Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes — verifies actual TrueNAS connectivity instead of just process liveness. Configurable via `HEALTH_LISTEN_ADDR` (default `:8081`)
- Add VM existence health check step — replaces `removeCDROM` step with `healthCheck` that verifies VMs still exist on TrueNAS and resets state for re-provision if deleted externally
- Add TrueNAS version check at startup — fails with clear error on versions below 25.04
- Add memory overcommit pre-check — blocks VMs requesting >80% of host RAM
- Add unknown field detection in MachineClass config — warns when unrecognized fields are present (typos, removed fields)
- Add `dataset_prefix` support for organizing VM storage under nested ZFS datasets
- Add `GetDatasetUserProperty()` client method for reading ZFS user properties
- Add CDROM swap logic for Talos version upgrades — **note: currently non-functional** because the Omni SDK does not re-run provision steps after a machine reaches `PROVISIONED` stage ([siderolabs/omni#2646](https://github.com/siderolabs/omni/issues/2646))

### Observability
- Add 17 new OTEL metrics: per-step provision/deprovision durations, error categorization, ISO cache hits/misses, cleanup counters, WebSocket reconnects, rate limit queue depth, graceful shutdown outcomes
- Add OTEL log-trace correlation via otelzap bridge (trace_id/span_id in structured logs)
- Split monolithic Grafana dashboard into 4 focused dashboards (overview, provisioning, API performance, cleanup)
- Add 4 new Prometheus alerting rules (health check failures, WebSocket reconnects, forced shutdowns, orphan VMs)
- Add Loki log aggregation config to observability stack

### Security & Hardening
- Pin Docker base images to SHA256 digest to prevent supply chain tag mutation
- Switch Docker runtime from Alpine to distroless/static-debian12 (no shell, smaller attack surface)
- Inject version into Docker image via build arg (was always "dev")
- Add OCI LABEL metadata (title, vendor, source, license)
- Add `SecretString` type that redacts API keys from logs and fmt output
- Default `TRUENAS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` to `false` (was `true`)
- Add security comments to TrueNAS app template and Kubernetes secret manifest
- Replace placeholder API key in `.env.test.example` with non-secret value
- Add betterleaks secret scanning: pre-push hook, CI job with pinned version + checksum

### Deployment
- Replace `pgrep` liveness probe with HTTP health checks in Kubernetes deployment manifest
- Add readiness probe to Kubernetes deployment
- Remove `ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE` from env config, secrets, and deployment manifests
